3D printed piston improvements:
- the pusher is too long so it flies on the end: MAKE IT SHORTER
- the width and length of the piston head should be slightly smaller than the hole in the treat column
- the thickness of the piston head should be the same width of the treat column (should be the same distance that the piston moves when it releases a treat)
- how to connect to treat column?

put this in the commit message when complete!
